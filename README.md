# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Lead Scoring.csv`, which contains various attributes of the leads.

## Files
- **lead_scoring.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis, data cleaning, model building, and evaluation.
- **Lead Scoring.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Goal
To identify the most promising leads, also known as "Hot Leads", for the sales team to focus on.
